# Music Recommender UI
This repository describes the process of designing a UI for a music recommender mobile application.

**The design process consists of six stages:**
1. Context analysis and defining requirements
2. Interaction sketching
3. Detailed design with Figma _(current stage)_
4. Heuristic evaluation
5. Redesign based on evaluation results
6. Implementing the final interactive prototype using ProtoPie

For each stage, there is a separate report file describing the design actions performed in that stage. These reports can be found in the reports folder.
