# Music Recommender UI
This repository describes the process of designing a UI for a music recommender mobile application.

**The design process consists of six stages:**
1. Context analysis and defining requirements
2. Interaction sketching (current stage)
3. Detailed design with Figma
4. Heuristic evaluation
5. Redesign based on evaluation results
6. Implementing the final interactive prototype using ProtoPie

For each stage, there is a separate report file describing the design actions performed in that stage. These reports can be found in the reports folder.
