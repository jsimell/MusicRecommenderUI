# Music Recommender UI
This repository describes the process of designing a UI for a music recommender mobile application.

**The design process consists of six stages:**
1. Context analysis and defining requirements
2. Interaction sketching
3. Detailed design with Figma (https://www.figma.com/proto/oyiZesm8i5ul5yB6vLFzN8/MusicRecommender?node-id=0-1&t=a72PxcyQ8r1DUJSS-1) 
4. Heuristic evaluation _(current stage)_
5. Redesign based on evaluation results
6. Implementing the final interactive prototype using ProtoPie

For each stage, there is a separate report file describing the design actions performed in that stage. These reports can be found in the reports folder.
