# Music Recommender UI
This repository describes the process of designing a UI for a music recommender mobile application.

**The design process consists of six stages:**
1. Context analysis and defining requirements ([Link to report](https://github.com/jsimell/MusicRecommender_UI-project/blob/main/reports/context-analysis.pdf))
2. Interaction sketching ([Link to report](https://github.com/jsimell/MusicRecommender_UI-project/blob/main/reports/wireflows.pdf))
3. Detailed (colorless) design with Figma ([Link to prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/YYcggJyYrdPS1aE8t1CQHG/Musicrecommender-old?node-id=1-3141&p=f&t=PIs74JXJ8Yb99Sth-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3141))
4. Receive heuristic evaluation from a fellow student
5. Redesign based on evaluation results
6. Finalize the design ([Link to the final prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/oyiZesm8i5ul5yB6vLFzN8/MusicRecommender?node-id=300-12600&m=dev&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=300%3A12600))

For some of the stages, there is a separate report file describing the design actions performed in that stage. All the reports can be found in the reports folder.
