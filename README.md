# Music Recommender UI
This repository describes the process of designing a UI for a music recommender mobile application.

**The design process consists of six stages:**
1. Context analysis and defining requirements ([Link to report](https://github.com/jsimell/MusicRecommender_UI-project/blob/main/reports/context-analysis.pdf))
2. Interaction sketching ([Link to report](https://github.com/jsimell/MusicRecommender_UI-project/blob/main/reports/wireflows.pdf))
3. Detailed (colorless) design with Figma ([Link to prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/oyiZesm8i5ul5yB6vLFzN8/MusicRecommender?node-id=0-1&t=a72PxcyQ8r1DUJSS-1))
4. Receive heuristic evaluation from a fellow student
5. Redesign based on evaluation results _(current stage)_
6. Finalize the design

For some of the stages, there is a separate report file describing the design actions performed in that stage. These reports can be found in the reports folder.
